# RV32I Single Cycle core

I'm in my third semester currently pursuing bachelors in Computer Science at Usman Institute of Technology, Pakistan. Being a trainee @ Micro Electronics Research Lab, I've designed a parameterized RISC-V 32-bit Single Cycle Core using functional programming in Scala and Chisel.
