# RV32I Single Cycle core

A GitHub repository showcasing my implementation of a RISC-V single-cycle processor. Dive into the heart of RISC-V architecture with this project, exploring a clean and concise single-cycle design. Ideal for those interested in digital design and processor architectures.

### Features:
- **Single-Cycle Design:** Simple and intuitive RISC-V processor implementation.
- **Chisel Source Code:** Access the complete Chisel source code for easy exploration and understanding.
- **Educational Resource:** Use it as a learning resource for RISC-V architecture and digital design.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use it as a starting point for your own projects. Happy coding! üåêüíª
